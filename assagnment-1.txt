Task:
1. Create a simple web application: You can use any language or framework youâ€™re comfortable with. The
application should have at least two pages: a home page and an about page.
2. Version Control: Initialize a Git repository in your project directory, make regular commits while
developing the application, and push your code to a remote repository on GitHub.
3. Write Tests: Write unit tests for your application. The tests should cover all the main functionalities of your
application.
4. Dockerize the Application: Create a Dockerfile for your application and push the image to Docker Hub or
any other container registry you prefer.
5. Set up CI/CD Pipeline: Use a CI/CD tool (like Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, etc.) to set up a pipeline for
your application. The pipeline should:
Be triggered on every push to the main branch of your remote repository.
Run all the unit tests.
Build a Docker image and push it to the registry if all tests pass.
6. Deploy the Application: Automatically deploy the application to a server whenever a new image is pushed
to the registry. You can use any cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or even a local server.
7. Document Your Work: Write a README file explaining what your application does, how to run it locally,
and how your CI/CD pipeline works. Include all the necessary commands and screenshots.
Deliverables:
Link to the remote GitHub repository.
Link to the Docker image in the registry.
Public IP address or URL where the deployed application can be accessed.
README file.
Remember, this assignment is not just about getting the task done but also about demonstrating best practices and
how you structure code in a real-world scenario. Good luck!
